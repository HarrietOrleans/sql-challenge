# sql-challenge
Module 9 Challenge

Folders in the file include an export of the ERD of the provided data. I also included a screenshot showing the full work. 

Files include EmployeeSQL_challenge which is the SQL file that I worked with. I copied my code into notepad and created two new .sql files: Table Schemata and Queries to show how I set up my tables and the queries that I ran to get the requested analysis. 

I was able to complete this homework by reviewing class recordings, activities, and searching for the questions that I had.
